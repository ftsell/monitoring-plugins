# Monitoring Plugins Collection

This Check Plugin Collection offers a package of Python-based, Nagios-compatible check plugins for Icinga, Naemon, Nagios, and other monitoring applications. 
Each plugin is a stand-alone command line tool that provides a specific type of check. 
Typically, the monitoring software will run these check plugins to determine the current status of hosts and services on the network.
